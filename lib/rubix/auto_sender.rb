  # == Sender
  #
  # Rubix comes with a +zabbix_pipe+ script which, coupled with the
  # {+zabbix_sender+}[http://www.zabbix.com/documentation/1.8/manpages/zabbix_sender]
  # utility, allows for writing data to Zabbix.
  #
  # By the design of Zabbix, all data written via +zabbix_sender+ (and
  # therefore +zabbix_pipe+) must be written to items with type "Zabbix
  # trapper".  This type instructs Zabbix to accept values written by
  # +zabbix_sender+.
  #
  # +zabbix_pipe+ can consume data from +STDIN+, a file on disk, or a
  # {named pipe}[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_pipe].  It consumes
  # data one line at a time from any of these sources and uses the
  # +zabbix_sender+ utility to send this data to a Zabbix server.
  #
  # Here's an example of starting +zabbix_pipe+ and sending some data onto
  # Zabbix.  (Credentials and addresses for the Zabbix server and the
  # Zabbix API can all be customized; see the <tt>--help</tt> option.)
  #
  #   # Send one data point -- this is tab separated!
  #   $ echo "foo.bar.baz	123" | zabbix_pipe --host='My Zabbix Host' --host_groups='My Zabbix Servers,Some Other Group'
  #   # Send a bunch of data points in a file
  #   $ cat my_data.tsv | zabbix_pipe --host='My Zabbix Host' --host_groups='My Zabbix Servers,Some Other Group'
  #
  # You can also pass the file directly:
  #
  #   # Send a bunch of data points in a file
  #   $ zabbix_pipe --host='My Zabbix Host' --host_groups='My Zabbix Servers,Some Other Group' my_data.tsv
  #
  # You can also listen from a named pipe.  This is useful on a
  # "production" system in which many processes may want to simply and
  # easily write somewhere without worrying about what happens.
  #
  #   # In the first terminal
  #   $ mkfifo /dev/zabbix
  #   $ zabbix_pipe --pipe=/dev/zabbix --host='My Zabbix Host' --host_groups='My Zabbix Servers,Some Other Group'
  #
  #   # In another terminal
  #   $ echo "foo.bar.baz	123" > /dev/zabbix
  #   $ cat my_data > /dev/zabbix
  #
  # In any of these modes, you can also send JSON data directly.
  #
  #   $ echo '{"data": [{"key": "foo.bar.baz", "value": 123}, {"key": "foo.bar.baz", "value": 101}]}' > /dev/zabbix
  #
  # This simple block of JSON doesn't really add any power to
  # +zabbix_pipe+.  What becomes more interesting is that we can wedge in
  # data for *diffferent* hosts, items, &c. when using JSON input:
  #
  #   $ echo '{"host": "My first host", "host_groups": "My Zabbix Servers,Some Other Group", "data": [{"key": "foo.bar.baz", "value": 123}, {"key": "foo.bar.baz", "value": 101}]}' > /dev/zabbix
  #   $ echo '{"host": "My second host", "host_groups": "My Zabbix Servers,Some Other Group", "data": [{"key": "foo.bar.baz", "value": 123}, {"key": "foo.bar.baz", "value": 101}]}' > /dev/zabbix
  #   $ echo '{"host": "My third host", "host_groups": "My Zabbix Servers,Some Other Group", "data": [{"key": "foo.bar.baz", "value": 123}, {"key": "foo.bar.baz", "value": 101}]}' > /dev/zabbix
  #
  # Rubix will switch hosts on the fly.
  #
  # === Auto-vivification
  #
  # By default, for every item written into +zabbix_pipe+, Rubix will
  # first check, using the Zabbix API, whether an item with the given key
  # exists for the given host.  If not, Rubix will create the host and
  # the item.  You can pass a few details along with your data (when
  # writing in JSON format) or at startup of the +zabbix_pipe+ to tune
  # some of the properites of newly created hosts and items:
  #
  #   $ echo '{"host": "My host", "hostgroups": "Host Group 1,Host Group 2", "templates": "Template 1,Template 2", "applications": "App 1, App2", "data": [{"key": "foo.bar.baz", "value": 123}, {"key": "foo.bar.baz", "value": 101}]}' > /dev/zabbix
  #
  # If the host 'My host' does not exist, Rubix will create it, putting in
  # each of the host groups 'Host Group 1' and 'Host Group 2' (which will
  # also be auto-vivified), and attach it to templates 'Template 1' and
  # 'Template 2' (auto-vivified).  If the item does not exist for the host
  # 'My host', then it will be created and put inside applications 'App1'
  # and 'App2' (auto-vivified).  The value type of the item (unsigned int,
  # float, character, text, &c.) will be chosen dynamically based on the
  # value being written. The created items will all be of the type "Zabbix
  # trapper" so that they can be written to.
  #
  # Auto-vivification is intended to make it easy to register a lot of
  # dynamic hosts and items in Zabbix.  This is perfect for cloud
  # deployments where resources to be monitored are often dynamic.
  #
  # ==== Failed writes
  #
  # By the design of Zabbix, a newly created item of type 'Zabbix trapper'
  # will not accept data for some interval, typically a minute or so,
  # after being created.  This means that when writing a series of values
  # for some non-existent item 'foo.bar.baz', the first write will cause
  # the item to be created (auto-vivified), the next several writes will
  # fail as the Zabbix server is not accepting writes for this item yet,
  # and then all writes will begin to succeed as the Zabbix server catches
  # up.  If it is absolutely essential for all writes to succeed,
  # including the first, then +zabbix_pipe+ needs to go to sleep for a
  # while after creating a new item in order to give the Zabbix server
  # time to catch up.  This can be configured with the
  # <tt>--create_item_sleep</tt> option.  By default this is set to 0.
  #
  # ==== Skipping auto-vivification
  #
  # Attempting to auto-vivify keys on every single write is expensive and
  # does not scale.  It's recommended, therefore, to run +zabbix_pipe+
  # with the <tt>--fast</tt> flag in production settings.  In this mode,
  # +zabbix_pipe+ will not attempt to auto-vivify anything -- if items do
  # not exist, writes will just fail, as they do with +zabbix_sender+
  # itself.
  #
  # A good pattern is to set up a production pipe (in <tt>--fast</tt>)
  # mode at <tt>/dev/zabbix</tt> and to do all development/deployment with
  # a separate instance of +zabbix_pipe+.  Once development/deployment is
  # complete and all hosts, groups, templates, applications, and items
  # have been created, switch to writing all data in "production mode"
  # using the <tt>--fast</tt> pipe at <tt>/dev/zabbix</tt>.
